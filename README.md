# VisionXPro_A_Website_Clone_Inspired_by_Apple_Vision_Pro

<p>VisionX Pro is a website that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on Apple's Vision Pro website. It's designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly. I used GSAP for cool animations that make the website more engaging and enjoyable to use. To ensure a smooth experience while scrolling, I implemented ScrollTrigger and Locomotive, which make navigating the website feel effortless. With VisionX Pro, you can explore a simplified version of Apple's Vision Pro website in interactive way.</p>
